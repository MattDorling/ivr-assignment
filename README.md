INFORMATION FOR TASK 4.3.
The file robot.urdf is the robot for section 4.3 with black joints. The file robot_backup.urdf is the robot for section 2 with coloured joints.
Please rename these as necessary for the task that you are running.

The python files that end with "4.3.py" are the files for section 4.3. The others are for section 2.

For using the control node, please run nodes image1_control, image2 and vision.
The reason we recommend image1_control is because move_joints function used for 2.1 is commented out, giving better accuracy for the control node
